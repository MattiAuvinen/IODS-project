# Testing...

I was informed of this this course by the amanuensis of our faculty and I thought it'd be interesting to learn more data science for at least the following reasons:
* Data science is an interesting field of work
* and it's very high in demand at the moment
* to fill up my schedule

I haven't yet looked at the future exercises so I'm not sure what to expect but I'm looking forward to it.
